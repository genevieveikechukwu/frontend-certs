            Letitia Wright is an artiste who has inspired me beyond measure. I was encouraged and pushed to start my
            Journey with the HolySpirit because of her.
            One of the things I love about her is how Vocal she is about her christianity. Even if we both are in
            different careers, she has inspired me to find purpose and use my skills/talent
            to bring people closer to God. I enjoy watching her Interviews where she talks about her journey with God.
